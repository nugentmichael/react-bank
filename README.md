## Available Scripts

Like many other React projects, once you've forked a copy of this repo, simply navigate to the project directory and execute the following command in your favourite Terminal app or code editor below:

### `npm start`

If you would like to contribute to this repo, simply include your code revisions within the repo and run the following command below to compile the app accordingly:
